## Hello

Welcome to my first blog entry, in which I'll summarize my background, what I do, and what I've been interested in lately.

### Background

In college, I studied mathematics and computer science. When I took my first college math course (intro calculus) during my first semester, I never took notes, had an inherent dislike of the subject matter (at least, as it was presented) and as a result did rather poorly. I was, largely due to my own shortcomings, scared of math for the next two years.

So I threw myself into the computer science major, which I found myself much more well suited for. It wasn't until my 3rd year that I found motivation to study math again. That motivation came when I took a Machine Learning course during the first semester of that year. I found the subject matter fascinating and insanely clever, but realized that I didn't have the background in math I needed to be able to read research papers and interesting discussions on the topic.

To make a long story short, I realized I had just enough time left to squeeze in a math major, and jumped in headfirst. Along the way I fell in love with linear and abstract algebra, information theory, and topology. 

### Current Work 

For work, I primarily use UE4 to build data visualizations. Working in a game engine has been a great experience: 
- by nature the work is interdisciplinary
- UE4 is a fantastically versatile and powerful piece of software
- I love games, and working in a tool designed to make them is exciting, even if what I'm making aren't really *games*
- I get to do a bit more pen-and-paper math than I was previously

Most of my off-the-clock tinkering time, however, is spent on other things i find captivating

### What I've Been Interested in Recently 

In my experience as a computer science student, the whole notion of electricity and the fundamental layers on which software abstractions are built were generally (and justifiably) treated as a black box. This makes sense for a standard CS program, but I like to understand the low level workings of the things I rely on. 

This drove me to start learning about electronics and prototyping circuits. I'm still a novice, but I'm fully captivated. 

I started by experimenting with small Arduino projects just to get some practical experience in working with some basic components. I then rid myself of the powerful black box that is the microcontroller, and began playing around with transistor-transistor logic (TTL) integrated circuits.

My main goal in this endeavor is to design and build a (hopefully non-trivial) microprocessor and some accompanying modules (like a basic programming interface). I've been inspired by, among many great resources and projects around the net, a wonderful book called [Digital Computer Electronics by Malvino and Brown](https://www.amazon.com/Digital-Computer-Electronics-Albert-Malvino/dp/0028005945). This book covers most of the fundamentals I was looking for, and walks the reader through the process of designing an 8 bit microprocessor that is forward compatible with the Intel 8080. 

We'll see how this whole thing pans out, I'm planning on writing another post to cover this project in more detail and to go over the design I'm shooting for.

If you made it this far, thanks for reading :)
