# Waves

Welcome. Previously, I wrote a post about how bipolar junction transistors can be used to implement digital logic. Since writing that post, I discovered the rabbit hole of audio electronics - specifically guitar effects pedals - and along with it a broader understanding of the role of the transistor.

While the content in my previous post isn't necessarily wrong (provides a working understanding of an important role BJT's play in the digital world), it reflects the limited perspective I had on these devices at the time. 

I set out to write an update covering transistors as amplifiers, but found that I wanted to include a brief primer on sound and audio signals. I put together some python scripts to generate some .wav files and plots, and ultimately that evolved into this program:
